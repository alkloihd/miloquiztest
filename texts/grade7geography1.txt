Major Communities in Early Canada
British Settlements
The **British colonies** were primarily concentrated in the Maritime regions and parts of Upper Canada (modern-day Ontario). British settlers brought their own systems of government, social hierarchies, and cultural practices. The colonial administration established a structured society with clear class distinctions, where wealthy merchants and government officials held significant power. **Colonial governors** appointed by Britain maintained strict control over local affairs.

French Communities
In Lower Canada (modern-day Quebec), the **French-speaking population** maintained strong cultural traditions despite British rule following the 1763 Treaty of Paris. The **seigneurial system** of land management continued to influence social organization, with Catholic parishes serving as important community centers. French customs, language, and religious practices remained deeply entrenched in daily life.

First Nations Communities
**Indigenous peoples** maintained their distinct cultural identities and traditional ways of life, though increasingly under pressure from European expansion. Different nations, such as the **Haudenosaunee** (Iroquois), **Anishinaabe**, and **Mi'kmaq**, had their own governance systems, spiritual practices, and social structures. Many First Nations communities engaged in trade with European settlers while working to preserve their independence and territorial rights.

Métis Communities
The **Métis people**, emerging from relationships between European fur traders and First Nations women, developed their own unique culture and identity. Their communities often served as important links between Indigenous and European societies, particularly in the fur trade. Métis settlements featured distinctive social organizations that blended Indigenous and European practices.

Inuit Communities
In the far north, **Inuit peoples** maintained their traditional ways of life, with seasonal hunting and gathering patterns determining community movements. Their social structure emphasized family and community cooperation, essential for survival in the Arctic environment.
